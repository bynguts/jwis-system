# JWIS Winning System (Jakarta Waste Intelligence System)

AI command center prototype for the AI Open Innovation Challenge 2026 DLH waste case (Case 1 & Case 2).

## What This Replaces

This version replaces the legacy Streamlit code with a high-performance React/Vite command center, a Python FastAPI backend, and a lightweight Node.js WhatsApp Gateway (Baileys).
The interface is a task-first operations product: a persistent command rail,
single-action decision surfaces, and dedicated desktop/mobile workflows built
with the repository's `taste-redesign` and `taste-default` constraints.

## Project Architecture

- **Frontend:** React + Vite, MapLibre GL, and a responsive command-center design system based on Geist Sans/Mono.
- **Backend:** FastAPI, OR-Tools CP-SAT (Integrated Planning optimizer), Prophet + XGBoost (Waste Forecast models), and an OpenAI Assistant route configured to stream via 9Router.
- **WhatsApp Gateway:** A standalone Express + `@whiskeysockets/baileys` gateway running on port 2785 for direct WhatsApp alert dispatching (no Puppeteer/headless browser overhead).

### Driver analytics data contract

`GET /api/fleet/driver-analytics` returns one current assignment per truck from
the cached `/api/command-center` fleet snapshot. The response includes
`sampled_at` (UTC ISO timestamp), `source: "command-center.trucks"`, bilingual
`provenance.id`/`provenance.en`, and `drivers` with truck code, driver name,
assigned zone, current status, damage flag, and current route-deviation flag
and distance. The interface refreshes every 15 seconds, marks snapshots older
than 30 seconds or failed refreshes as stale, and keeps the last snapshot visible
on refresh failure. Rows and KPIs describe current assignments, **not**
historical trips, fuel efficiency, or driver performance scores. Pilot telemetry
and assignments are simulated; fleet composition uses the DKI 2023 truck census.

### Durable record storage

SPJ work orders, submitted event permits, pre-trip inspections, damage reports,
and service history live in SQLite record stores (`app/storage.py`,
`RecordStore`) whose location follows `JWIS_DB_PATH` (its directory when set,
otherwise the temp directory). Mutations are transactional: a request is only
acknowledged after the row commits, a failed commit returns HTTP 503 instead of
a success object, and the SPJ lifecycle uses `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` read-modify-write
transactions so two API workers cannot both activate an order for the same
truck or allocate the same daily number. Any pre-existing `jwis_*.json` store is
imported once on first start and renamed `*.json.migrated`.

### Operational resource units

`app/units.py` is the single source for every resource quantity, and each API
response carries a `units` glossary next to the numbers:

| Field | Unit |
|---|---|
| `trucks_required` | trucks (1 truck = 18 t per shift) |
| `crews_required` | crew teams (1 team operates 1 truck) |
| `workers_required` | people (crews × 4) |
| `man_hours_required` | person-hours (workers × 8 h shift) |
| `bins_required` | large bins (2.5 t each) |
| `recommended_extra_*` | the same units, for demand above the baseline |

### SPJ evidence and override

Closing a stop requires field evidence (arrival photo, weighing, officer).
`POST /api/spj/{id}/complete` is the exceptional path: it needs a supervisor
override with a reason and is gated by the `dispatch:override` permission, which
only the `supervisor` and `administrator` roles hold. Receipt submission is
idempotent per `operation_id`; replacing an existing receipt requires a
`replace_reason` and archives the previous one in `receipt_history`. Destination
coordinates come from `app/facilities.py`; a destination without a sourced
coordinate (`JRC Pesanggrahan`) is reported as `usable_for_routing: false` and
does not become a deviation-scoring reference path.

## Complete Demo Flow

1. **Sign In:** Enter username `dispatcher` and password `dispatcher-demo-pass`.
2. **Fleet Operations (Case 1):**
   - View simulated fleet positions and route deviations on the Live Fleet Map; positions are not live GPS.
   - Observe that `T-047` is off-corridor (marked in yellow).
   - Click the **A* Simulate Jam** button. Watch `T-047` dynamically calculate a new road-following route to TPA Bantargebang.
   - Look at the TPA Queue and staggered dispatch slots.
   - Click **Send Alert** in the Action Queue to dispatch the reroute instruction.
   - Open `/field` in another tab, log in as `driver`, and confirm the dispatch instruction.
   - Back in Fleet Operations, the confirmation is synced instantly.
3. **Waste Forecast & AI Assistant (Case 2):**
   - Navigate to **Waste Forecast**.
   - Browse/filter the 42 Kecamatan map/list. Click a Kecamatan to expand its 3-column resource optimization dashboard (predicted waste tonnage, fuel consumption, carbon emissions, crew, and fleet mix).
   - Use the **Operational AI Assistant** at the bottom: type a question, and it will respond via the 9Router gateway using custom domain knowledge.
4. **Integrated Planning:**
   - Review constraints and approve the weekly staggered queue plan.
5. **Data & ML Audit:**
   - Audit the Prophet/XGBoost models' accuracy metrics (WAPE, MAE), training limits, and data provenance.

## Installation & Running Locally

### 1. WhatsApp Gateway (Baileys)
Make sure Node.js is installed. Run the gateway server:
```powershell
cd "jwis/backend/wa-gateway"
npm install
node server.js
```
*Note: A QR code will display in the terminal. Scan it with your WhatsApp app (authenticated as `6289675877496` or any driver phone).*

### 2. Backend API
Make sure Python (3.10+) is installed. Install dependencies and run the API:
```powershell
cd "jwis/backend"
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create a .env file inside jwis/backend/ with the following:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your-9router-api-key
# OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://100.67.31.81:20128/v1
# OPENAI_MODEL=graphify
# OPENWA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:2785/api
# OPENWA_API_KEY=your-wa-api-key
# OPENWA_SESSION_ID=default

python -m uvicorn app.main:app --port 8001
```
*Note: The backend will warm all Prophet + XGBoost prediction caches on startup (~20-25 seconds) to ensure instant responses.*

### 3. Frontend Web App
Run the production build preview (optimized layout):
```powershell
cd "jwis/frontend"
npm install
npm run build
npm run preview -- --port 5175
```
Access the app at: **http://localhost:5175**

## Testing & Verification

Run the full end-to-end Playwright tests to verify zero regressions:
```powershell
cd "jwis/frontend"
npm run build   # required: the preview server serves dist/ — a stale dist causes false e2e failures
npx playwright test --workers 1
```
*(The suite covers the current end-to-end workflows.)*
