facility_planning.py — Case 2 facility-readiness engine.

Answers the case-statement requirement "estimated need and LOCATION of waste
disposal and transportation facilities in each busy area": for every kecamatan
it compares the live model-predicted demand against the TPS capacity proxy and
recommends (a) how many TPS sites / transfer trucks are missing, and (b) WHERE
to site them — the highest-demand kelurahan with the thinnest TPS coverage,
using the same population+TPS weighted allocation as the heatmap.

Capacity values are a PROXY (see data provenance registry), so every output
carries the proxy label and never presents derived numbers as official DLH
operational capacity.
